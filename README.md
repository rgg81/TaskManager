# Task Manager
With Task Manager we refer to a software component that is designed for handling multiple processes inside an operating system. Each process is identified by 2 fields, a unique unmodifiable identifier (PID), and a priority (low, medium, high). The process is immutable, it is generated with a priority and will die with this priority â€“ each process has a kill() method that will destroy it

functionality: Add a process, List running processes and Kill/KillGroup/KillAl
